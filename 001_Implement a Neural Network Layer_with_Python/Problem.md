# Neural Network Layer with Activation Function

## Overview

In this problem, your task is to implement a neural network layer with an activation function using Python and NumPy. The layer should be capable of performing the forward pass computation, which involves calculating the output of the layer given input data, weights, and biases, and applying an activation function to the output.
